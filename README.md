# About this project
A front-end practice based on the designs done during the course of [ShiftNudge](https://shiftnudge.com/). This exercise is the menifetation of the explorations of [design exploration of title and body](https://www.figma.com/design/7jY40Z13Tg2TR6gBYaoy4Q/course-results?node-id=1-2187&t=PTB4ozM1hPDHEqwg-1)


# Pocketbase
For the sake of convenience, [pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) was used to have a quicker back-end ready.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
